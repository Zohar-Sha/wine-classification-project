# üç∑ Wine Classification Project

This project classifies wine types (0, 1, 2) based on 13 chemical features using supervised learning.

## Summary of Steps:
- Data loading and exploration with visualizations (heatmap, boxplot, histplot, scatterplot, countplot)
- Model training with Logistic Regression and Random Forest (with and without SelectKBest feature selection)
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV with 5-fold cross-validation
- Performance evaluation using macro-averaged F1 score
- Final model testing and validation
